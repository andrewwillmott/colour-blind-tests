These pages contain result images from the
[colour-blind-luts](https://github.com/andrewwillmott/colour-blind-luts)
codebase. They consist of selected [Ishihara test
images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishihara_test), plus some stock images
from the literature, with various blindness simulation and correction filters
applied.

See the 'generate' script from that repository to regenerate these results

The full sets of results are:

* [Protanopia](out/results-protanope.md), the most common form of
  [red/green colour blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness#Red-green_color_blindness).
* [Deuteranopia](out/results-deuteranope.md), a less common form of this.
* [Tritanopia](out/results-tritanope.md), [yellow/blue colour
  blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness#Blue-yellow_color_blindness),
  quite rare compared to the other two.
